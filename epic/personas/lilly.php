		<p>Age: 23</p>
		<p>Gender: Female</p>
		<p>User Story: Lilly is a private 2nd class in the US army. She is has been deployed to Afghanistan for 2 months. She is single,
		and has no kids. Her only close family relation back home is her father. Lilly was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. This
		is her 2nd deployment. She finds herself missing the small comforts of home like her favorite candy, red licorice. She wished she
		had a new book to read on her off time and a deck of cards to play with her platoon. Plus there are a few other necesites she need
		like thicker socks and more stationary. Her frustration is that she hates to always have to ask her father to gather thing and send
		them to her because he is not well. She has limited access to a computer with internet. Can use the one on base. She also can use her
		cell phone but can use only limited amount of time because of her mission. </p>
